# Compressed DNN

Numerical experiments can be performed with odin which organizes the computations into different parts and 

# Usage of odin

Odin is a wraps and abstracts computations with chainer, keras and tensorflow to some extent
It is currently only made for this specific projects functionality

Its operation revolves around executing actions that will do some
computation and save it at a standard location categorized by its
model name and prefix.

Results of computations and graphs are all stored in the results directory and further organized
by model name and optional prefix

## Actions
Actions are functions in the odin.actions module which does some computation or plotting
